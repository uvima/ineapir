## Overview

inepair provides a set of functions to obtain open data and metadata published
by the National Statistics Institute of Spain 
([INE](https://www.ine.es/en/index.htm)). The data is obtained thanks to calls
to the INE API service which allows access via URL requests to all the
available statistical information published by INE.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **ineapir** like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
install_github("/ineapir")
```

## Data request examples

The data is only associated with the series object and these can be grouped
together into statistical tables. The field named '*Valor*' is the only one 
that contains data. The rest of the fields are necessary for the data to be
well defined.

### Obtaining data from a series

To get the last data of a series it is necessary to pass the `codSeries`
argument which is the identification code of the series.

```{r series_data}
library(ineapir)
series <- get_data_series(codSeries = "IPC251856")
series$Data
```

To get the last n data from a series it is necessary to pass the `nlast`
argument as well.

```{r series_data_n}
series <- get_data_series(codSeries = "IPC251856", nlast = 5)
series$Data
```

Additionally, it is possible to obtain data from a series between two dates.
The date must have and specific format (*yyyy/mm/dd*). If the end date is not
specified we obtain all the data from the start date.

```{r series_data_date}
series <- get_data_series(codSeries = "IPC251856", dateStart = "2023/01/01", 
                          dateEnd = "2023/04/01")
series$Data
```

### Obtaining data from a table

To get all the data of a table it is necessary to pass the `idTable`
argument which is the identification code of the table.

```{r table_data}
table <- get_data_table(idTable = 50902)
table[1,c("COD", "Nombre")]
head(table$Data[[1]])
```

To get the last n data from a table it is necessary to pass the `nlast`
argument as well.

## Metadata request examples

Structural metadata are objects that describe both time series and statistical
tables and allow their definition. All these database objects have an
associated identifier that is essential for the correct use of the service.

### Obtaining statistical operations

The database contains information about all short-term statistical operations,
those with a periodicity for disseminating results of less than a year, 
as well as some structural statistical operations.

```{r operations}
operations <- get_metadata_operations()
head(operations)
```

An operation can be identify by a numerical code ('*Id*'), an alphabetic code
('*Codigo*') or by the code of the statistical operation in the Inventory of
Statistical Operations (IOE + '*Cod_IOE*'). To obtain information about only
one operation we have to pass the `operation` argument with one of these codes.

```{r operation}
operation <- get_metadata_operations(operation = "IPC")
as.data.frame(operation)
```

### Obtaining variables

We can get all the variables of the system.

```{r variables}
variables <- get_metadata_variables(lang = "EN")
head(variables)
```

A variable can be identify by a numerical code ('*Id*'). In addition, if we
pass the `operation` argument we obtain the variables used in an operation.

```{r variables_opertation}
variables <- get_metadata_variables(operation = "IPC", lang = "EN")
head(variables)
```

### Obtaining values

To get all the values that a variable can take it is necessary to pass the
`variable` argument which is the identifier of the variable.

```{r values}
values <- get_metadata_values(variable = 3, lang = "EN")
head(values)
```

A value can be identify by a numerical code ('*Id*'). In addition, if we pass
the `operation` argument as well we obtain the values that the variable takes
in that particular operation.

```{r values_operation}
values <- get_metadata_values(operation = "IPC", variable = 3, lang = "EN")
head(values)
```

### Obtaining tables

We can get the tables associated with an statistical operation.

```{r tables}
tables <- get_metadata_tables(operation = "IPC")
head(tables[,c("Id","Nombre")])
```

A table is defined by different groups or selection combo boxes and each of
them by the values that one or several variables take. To obtain the
variables and values present in a table first we have to query the groups
that define the table:

```{r groups}
groups <- get_metadata_table_groups(idTable = 50902)
head(groups)
```

Once we have the identification codes of the groups, we can query the values
for an specific group.

```{r group_values}
values <- get_metadata_table_Values(idTable = 50902, idGroup = 110889)
head(values, 4)
```

### Obtaining series

The data is only associated with the series object. To obtain information
about a particular series it is necessary to pass the `codSeries` argument
which is the identification code of the series.

```{r series}
series <- get_metadata_series(codSeries = "IPC251856")
as.data.frame(series)
```

To get the values and variables that define a series it is necessary to pass
the `codSeries` argument as well.

```{r series_values}
values <- get_metadata_series_values(codSeries = "IPC251856")
head(values)
```

To get all the series that define a table it is necessary to pass the
`idTable` argument which is the identification code of the table.

```{r series_table}
series <- get_metadata_series_table(idTable = 50902)
head(series[,c("COD", "Nombre")], 4)
```
